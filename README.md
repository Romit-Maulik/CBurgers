# Description

This branch has code/documentation relevant to running this application on ThetaGPU using optimized datascience machine learning libraries. For generic information about this code please visit the Readme.MD of the master branch.

These are the steps to execute this code on ThetaGPU (interactively):
1. Login to a ThetaGPU head node
```
ssh thetagpusn1
```
2. Request an interactive session on an A100 GPU
```
qsub -n 1 -q default -A datascience -I -t 1:00:00
```
Following this, we need to execute a few commands to get setup with an appropriately optimized tensorflow. These are:
3. Activate the TensorFlow 2.2 singularity container:
```
singularity exec -B /lus:/lus --nv /lus/theta-fs0/projects/datascience/thetaGPU/containers/tf2_20.08-py3.sif bash
```
4. Setup access to the internet
```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://theta-proxy.tmi.alcf.anl.gov:3128
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://theta-proxy.tmi.alcf.anl.gov:3128
```
Now that we can access the internet, we need to set up a virtual environment in Python (these commands should only be run the first time)
```
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
export VENV_LOCATION=/home/rmaulik/THETAGPU_TF_ENV # Add your path here
python -m virtualenv --system-site-packages $VENV_LOCATION
python -m pip install cmake
python -m pip install matplotlib
```
5. Now we are ready to build our executable by executing the provided shell script:
```
source setup.sh
```
6. You can now run the app using
```
mpirun -n 1 -npernode 1 -hostfile $COBALT_NODEFILE ./app
```
